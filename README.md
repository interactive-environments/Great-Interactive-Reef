# Guide into the code

## Connect components

The components in your fanny pack should connect to a specific pin on the Bitsy Expander to make it work out of the box.

## System Diagram

This System Diagram is drawn in the visual style that is mandatory in the Interactive Environments minor. You can find more about it in our Knowledge Gallery for if you want to create a system diagram for your creature. On the Interactive Technology day we focus on designing the technology of one creature, so the network connection is not active at first.
